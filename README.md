# Run-to-Earn Platform

## Usage

Run-to-Earn is a decentralized platform designed to incentivize physical activities like running by rewarding users with cryptocurrency. 
We are currently in the early development phase, and this version includes the second feature: a working prototype with a smart contract and a basic front-end.

### Current Features Implemented

- **Smart Contract**: Handles reward distribution based on the distance run, using Ethereum-based tokens.
- **Frontend Prototype**: Users can connect their wallet, simulate a run, and view their earned rewards in real-time.

### How to Start Running and Earning:

1. **Connect Wallet**: Click on the "Connect Wallet" button.

3. **End Run**: Once done, click "End Run" to stop tracking and receive rewards.
4. **View Rewards**: Check your reward balance displayed in the UI.

### Smart Contract Overview

- **trackRunAndDistributeReward**: Logs userâ€™s run and distributes rewards based on distance.
